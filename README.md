# Weather-Forecaster

## Description

I set out to piece together a web app that would on command display simple weather information with a user search. The application uses the openWeather Api call to display selected information on a location of the user's search. Through this development I learned quite a bit about how to not only use Api calls but to log and retrieve information from the return. This knowledge has further helped me become more dynamic in my ability to display data based on a wider set of conditions.

## Installation

There are no needed steps to installation, simply open the web app and enter a desired city.

## Usage

Once the user opens the web App, they will see a search bar on the top left. Entering a city in the field will yield simple weather results for the current day, and then 5 days following it. The forecast results display temperature, conditions, wind speed and day and time of set data for future forecasts.
